console.log("hi")
```

```java
public static void main(String[] argv) {
    system.println("Hello world!");
}
```

```c
int main() {
  int y = SOME_MACRO_REFERENCE;
  int x = 5 + 6;
  cout << "Hello World! " << x << std::endl();
}
```

```csharp
private void index(){
  MessageBox.Show("hello world");
}
```

require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

@github/support What do you think about these updates?

@octocat :+1: This PR looks great - it's ready to merge! :shipit:

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
